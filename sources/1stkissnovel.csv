He said resolutely “I want her!”
With a decree the emperor bestowed marriage.
One after another everyone dropped by to congratulate Gu Jiu. Sure enough it was her dumb luck to marry the Imperial Grandson. Facing everyone’s blessings Gu Jiu smiled on the surface but in her heart she was cursing fiercely. 
In her lifetime the luckiest thing that happened to Gu Jiu was to die of illness but unexpectedly traverse to the ancient times and live a second time. And the most unfortunate thing that happened to her was meeting the Imperial Grandson Liu Zhao. 
—
It was rumoured that Imperial Grandson Liu Zhao was graceful elegant gentle refined humble polite and courteous.
Gu Jiu: Hehe!
The world was blind. That man was obviously two-faced cunning deceitful treacherous with the ambition of wild wolves and a great villain. He was like the tyrannical male lead who is written by the screenwriter to die in the finale but fans still feel distressed for him. 
—
It was rumoured that the Gu family’s second daughter Gu Jiu was soft gentle virtuous frail and tender. 
Liu Zhao: What? Gentle virtuous frail and tender is all fake. 
That woman was obviously aojiao selfish bad-tempered and narrow-minded; a little foodie with a soft and delicate body that wasn’t easy to push down.

The first time they met:
When Liu Zhao tried to misbehave with Gu Jiu her mind came up with 108 ways of murdering him. 
Gu Jiu defended herself pointing at Liu Zhao and said “You won’t do!”
Pfft!
Liu Zhao was completely defeated.

The second time they met:
Gu Jiu fell into the lake. Liu Zhao heroically rescued the beauty.
Gu Jiu slapped the back of his hand “Spoiling my good deeds!”
Liu Zhao was completely defeated once again.

At last there came a day when Liu Zhao married Gu Jiu back home.
The little foodie with a soft and delicate body that wasn’t easy to push down was finally locked up in his embrace. 
He said lovingly “Wife it’s not early. Let’s enter the bridal chamber ba.”
Gu Jiu smiled bashfully “Husband my body is uncomfortable. I’m afraid we cannot enter the bridal chamber tonight.”
Pfft!
Liu Zhao once again suffered 10000 points of injury.

Thus the mild-tempered Miao Anyun was picked by the system to transmigrate into different worlds acting as the male lead.
There was no need to follow the original work to protect the plot line because even Lord System felt that the plots of these worlds had essentially already collapsed and were probably beyond saving. Meaning if the plot could be bent back he should do it but if he couldn’t then it was fine.
Miao Anyun didn’t even need to stay in character. Lord System only had one basic requirement——he had to make sure the male lead stayed alive.
At first Miao Anyun didn’t make any unnecessary moves as he just wanted to quietly go about his own business. However for some inexplicable reason these male supporting lead and villain counter-attackers approached him one after another constantly gluing themselves to his side.

Lord System: The plot was bent back but why do I still feel sorry for the host… You animals stay away from my family’s host bastards!

He looked like a big silly softie and a newbie who was easy to pick on!
Ning Wan decided to beat this neglected novice into shape—
“Fu Zheng is it? The newcomers here must be obedient and discerning.”
“When I dig a pit you fill the soil. When I eat meat you drink the soup. When I go east you can’t go west… In short in this remote place which is beyond the reach of the central government I am God here.”
Although he was a little silly this newbie was a bit handsome obedient and tactful. She had gone soft on him and decided to impart him the half-assed ultimate skill she cultivated for a lifetime: how to shift the blame; how to loaf on the job; how to pay lip service to the boss?
She was very sincere and held nothing back—
“To tell you the truth my unique skills are not without cost. I advise you to like me as soon as possible. Let me analyze the advantages of liking me and the disadvantages of not liking me…”
The big silly softie Fu Zheng lost to the coercion and temptation and eventually succumbed. From that day on he devoted himself to Ning Wan.

The renowned Lin family of the Yan kingdom lived in luxury and extravagance. Their extreme wealth had already continued for three generations.
However the famous Lin family faced an awkward problem at their third generation— the master of the family had no son.
Although the master of the Lin family had seven concubines he had not gained a son for years. Master Lin eventually became too old to have any hope for a male heir.
The rise and fall of the Lin family now rests on the shoulders of master Lin’s only legitimate daughter: Lin Buxian.
The Lin family appeared to be powerful and untouchable but it was actually surrounded with danger.
Their wealth was hankered after by powerful ministers and coveted by their relatives. Lin Buxian was a woman but she had to step out often. Because of this she was often denounced by the public. Eight merchants came to attend Lin Buxian’s twentieth birthday but they heard the shocking news that her past childhood friend had already become the lucky son-in-law of a Minister and he intended to take her as a concubine?
Lin Buxian made an announcement to the entire kingdom during her birthday banquet; the Lin estate is looking for a handsome son-in-law to marry and live with the bride’s family.

However she woke up again this time with prior knowledge of herself being just a cannon fodder in a sweet romance novel. In the original novel Qinghe had saved the male protagonist’s life and then asked him to marry her as repayment. She then made the lovers’ lifetime a hell because of her jealousy.

But unexpectedly the original male protagonist was not reconciled to this and rushed to become entangled with her ruthlessly. She had a violent temper and rolled up her sleeves intending to hit him. Another man beside her saw this and felt very distressed. Hurriedly taking her hand and squeezing it gently he said “Be good. If you’re not careful your hand will hurt. You should stand aside and let me do such menial work.”

In his last life Zhou Chengkang had built and maintained a large tombstone in front of Li Qinghe’s grave for his entire life after her death. He regretted not expressing the feelings in his heart to her many times. He then died still carrying that regret.
When he opened his eyes again he found that he was reborn and had returned to the time before she had gotten married to Xu Changjie. The beautiful lady was again alive and graceful drawing at his heartstrings. He couldn’t help but want to take her into his arms.

The man in front of her looked brilliant. He was handsome and tall and his eyes were particularly charming.
‘Nonsense! How could someone so good-looking like him be industry cancer?’ She thought.
That was until she was severely beaten by socialism – When she tried to persuade her handsome boss on taking a case of public rights protection her boss gave her a blank look.
“What do you think a successful lawyer should do?”
“Work with passion?”
“What’s my surname?”
“Qian* of course!”
“Therefore I will only work for cash.”
…
When she asked for a raise her boss was unconvinced. And at the KTV party he participated in for the first time he made sure to give her a “reality check”.
It was hosted in a small theater. At that night she had drunk too much. Cheng Yao ran to the stage and picked up the microphone.
“What’s up with Qian Heng? This guy’s amazing! Isn’t he impressive? I must have gone insane to let him call me ‘baby’ that day! I Cheng Yao must make this clear! WHAT! GOES! AROUND! COMES! AROUND!”
No one could forget Qian Heng’s terrible expression that night…
But what they didn’t know was that the next day Qian Heng pushed Cheng Yao into a corner and said with an unreadable expression “Were you satisfied last night baby?”
*the character for the last name “Qian” also means “money”

He was surprised.
She explained “I’m sorry I have a slight hand fetish.”
He hesitated for a rather long time. “I’m sorry I’m a bit of a clean freak.”

Some time in the future he stood in the bathroom of their new apartment holding a scalpel with his bloody hands. His back was to her. There was blood all over the floor and a broken limb. From the pile of bloody bones she could tell that they belonged to the stray dog she had brought home.
She asked “What are you doing?”
He answered “Dissecting a corpse.”
She took a step back but he pressed her down to the cold floor of the bathroom and ripped off her clothes. The blood on the floor stained her snow-white skin.
He said “Shengsheng if I can choose how I die I hope I die on top of you.”
He said “Shengsheng I’m a doctor who can’t cure himself. I’m sick blood makes me excited and compels me to slaughter and you make me feel thirsty for blood. You’re the reason why I’m driven to murder.”
He said “Shengsheng save me. If you don’t hold my hand I’ll kill myself after I kill everybody who tries to take you away from me.”
She took his hand and said “Shi Jin the blood on the floor will dirty my shoes. I want you to carry me out of here.”
She had never loved someone so much that she was willing to descend into hell with him.
He had never loved someone so much that he was willing to set aside his butcher knife for her.

She had fought on the battlefields for years bringing peace to Xi Qiang stopping the barbarians… When her brother recovered she gave up her position with great laurels brought to her name. Without further ado she was married off.
During her married life she was forsaken by her husband and even suffered from a strange illness thereby losing her eyesight…
The young and pretty concubine stood in front of her speaking softly: “The decoction you had drunk that made you blind was instructed to be send to you by the elders of your family. But as you know the dead tell no tales. If you live you will be your family’s greatest threat!”
A great general of her time the heroine of the country died pitifully in the hands of those shameless women who only knew to fight for a man’s favor… How absurd!
When she opened her eyes again she had become the drill fields officer’s daughter who was weak and arrogant innocent and naive.
They had stolen her glory taken her life lead her army and betrayed her feelings! She had crawled back from the depths of hell and would take back everything she had lost one by one.
Bring the world under her feet and with her beauty and nobility overwhelm the nine prefectures!
But would she get out easily once she entered the barracks?
Hardly did she begin her adventures when He Yan met her arch-enemy of the previous lifetime that young hunk whose “enemies would retreat as soon as he attacked”.
The chic and cool female general versus the handsome and ravenous young man. Two efficient generals team up to conquer the world!

After her demise she was magically transported back in time to the Xia Dynasty to start a new life where she assumed the identity of an 8-year-old female servant. In order to help Yan Xun the Prince of Yan Bei escape she lived in the imperial palace for eight years along with him. In the process they helped each other to become stronger such that they could rebel against the Xia Empire and return to the territory of Yan Bei. 
The first half of the novel depicts vividly how the two characters go through thick and thin hand in hand – Chu Qiao helping Yan Xun to achieve his dreams and Yan Xun’s love towards Chu Qiao. However the two of them start to drift apart due to their conflicting personalities – Chu Qiao having a kind hearted nature and Yan Xun having the airs of a prince: arrogant and boisterous. 
Chu Qiao eventually leaves Yan Xun and ends up together with Zhuge Yue who had always fancied her all along. The two of them eventually become recognised as the famous Queen of Beauty and the King of the Green Sea establishing a prosperous long-standing and stable dynasty. The old monarchy system was undoubtedly and easily scrapped; the new Xia Empire helmed by the two of them rose from the verge of its downfall like a phoenix from the ashes!

Everything about him was good except that his family background was not strong enough and his personality was too cold.
Years later the former Qing Leng Xueba[1] became the biggest name in the business world but he married the second lady of the Yi family who was not favored and had a bad temper.
But no one know why Yi Yan married Jiang Xiche. There were three reasons; First because of money; second because of how handsome Jiang Xiche looks and the last reason was to annoy her elder sister. 
Unfortunately after marriage she was ridiculed by her elder sister as a “living widow” because she lived separately from her husband for a long time.     
But one early morning Yi Yan was shocked to find herself in the arms of a handsome man “Why are you here? When did you come back?”
The person who flew back from Italy overnight said with a low expression: “I arrived in the middle of the night after finishing my work.”
Yi Yan and Jiang Xiche slept in the same bed for two months and Jiang Xiche’s physical desire for her remained at kissing.
Even when she took the initiative to seduce him he would be the same; calm and relaxed.
Seeing this Yi Yan started to think that her charm was not enough and she slowly began to lose her self-confidence due to which she became quite frustrated.
Until one day the two had a conflict Yi Yan came home at night and lied to Jiang Xiche that she had cheated on him and that she had just come back after having fun with other men.
The man who had always been calm and self-sufficient suddenly seemed to have changed. Confining her to the wall like an awakened demon he looked extremely dangerous.
Yi Yan was frightened and asked Jiang Xiche “What do you want to do?” The other party’s voice was deep “It’s exciting to play with you.”
[1](清冷)Qīnglěng is a word meaning cold (学霸)Xué bà is a slang used to refer top student or bookworm. Here the author is referring Jiang Xiche as a cold top student.

And so she made a scene on her wedding day and had an affair on the third day!
Su Man-er transmigrated to the point in the story when the original owner was hiding in a hut with a man while the male lead and the villagers were waiting outside to catch them red-handed.
As the elite of the flower demon clan Su Man-er didn’t even hesitate before she knocked the man out. Humph a man like that wasn’t even worthy enough to touch her feet!

“Do you want your official female lead back?” asked Su Man-er. For some odd reason when the words “official female lead” left her mouth she felt a sense of unease as though… as though there was a thorn stuck in her heart.
Chi YunChen looked at her profoundly and said “If she was the one that I wanted to be with I wouldn’t have sided with you during the hut incident. Su Man-er now that I have married you I will be responsible for you for the rest of my life. Unless you don’t want to be with me and don’t want to be my wife anymore.”
As long as she stayed he’d be her loyal husband for life.
Su Man-er was touched by his words. Biting her lip she hesitated on what to say.
On the other hand he suddenly reached out grabbed her on her shoulder and said “I have been frank with you. Isn’t it your turn now to do the same?”

From then on if there are grievances settle those grievances if there are grudges settle those grudges. What does the Princess think?”

The magic energy flowing in this world is able to collect and form into two embodiments: the Shimmering Flower (幻光花) which grows in waves in the fields of Wong and the Saffrea gem (莎华宝石) used as currency in the greater parts of the world. 
The hierarchy of the world is divided into three sects: the Chosen humans who are highly receptive to the magical energies of the world and possess their own special brand of magical powers; the Fanatics humans who are not receptive to magic but use the Saffrea to bestow upon them their powers; and the powerless some of whom instead choose to divert their resourcefulness to become Alchemists humans who dabble in the art of infusing magic to machinery.
In the current trajectory of the world the continent of Varlhun has been split into four nations: Wong the origin of it all; Agnesa a nation built by Alchemists exiled from Wong; Fersares a former colony of Agnesa and Tarpaz a democratic nation built by emigrants from Wong. Agnesa and Fersares are experiencing a detente coming down from the conclusion of the recent Agnesa-Fersares war only stopped due to a disastrous explosion of magical energy eight years ago in one of Agnesa’s fort strongholds Fort Arcadina. The result of this explosion is a space-time distortion in the surrounding area creating an area that seems to be perpetually enveloped in darkness and that has become teeming with unknown monsters. To combat this the nation of Fersares has set up a number of Guilds the growth of which is unprecedented and that has now established bases in the other nations of Agnesa and Wong. Meanwhile the looming energy shortage in Agnesa and the avarice of power in Tarpaz bring a foreboding to the stability of the continent…
The story follows closely six perspectives: Vyrut Chrono the young commander of a special secret Tarpazian squad Shun Oldwin the Crown Prince of Wong who seeks answers to events that had led to his sister Miyo’s amnesia Rhea Turner and Yuno Asker two Agnesian heirs who seek answers to the downfall of their close relatives in Fort Arcadina Gloria Vella and Emon J two Fersarian mercenaries and Gian Lannal a Tarpazian exchange student to Wong who’s managed to embroil himself in the tangle of stories.

(a semi-autobiography)
For some people finding their love will take decades
but for her and him they were their first loves.
This is the story of her and Ling Jun’s love of seven years.
Was it luck or fate?
Maybe both.
　　That’s the bad thing about a first love; at a young age you can’t endure being lonely and you’ll be curious to explore the outside world. One person must mature first among the two people- to give guidance or else the risk of the first love dying out is very high. At any time and place even when you want to strangle them sometimes you must carefully care for them no matter what. However the lovers that can overcome this first difficult step will greatly surpass the wind and waves of the sea than other sheltered lovers.
　　I understood this meaning earlier than most people and that’s why I could persist to now- only a flower that blooms can produce fruit.
　　The world has tens of thousands of good people but you can only
encounter a few of the right people in a lifetime. Even so please do not panic.
　　As long as you patiently wait the best years of your youth will definitely last a long time. 
Then one day you will unexpectedly meet them by chance.

Thus Shang Ke started a never-ending (forced) cycle of constantly throwing away his miserable life.
He would always show himself as a martyr while letting others cry over his death.
It was because of a woman’s curse that Shang Ke was hit by a car and turned into a human vegetable. This led to him becoming bound by an unlucky system in which he was cursed to die. The most unfortunate part was that he never cheated on anyone’s feelings. The reason for why he was cursed by a woman was because of a guy named Qi Chen. Qi Chen was a ladies man and he would always use Shang Ke as an excuse to break up with any woman that he was with. As a result Shang Ke was always blamed for the breakups. Since then the main character could only be forced to cross into different worlds. He would thus experience for himself the hero’s “thrill”.
