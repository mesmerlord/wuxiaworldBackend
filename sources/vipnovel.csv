A magic button which can achieve the same effect as training for 100 million years if you push it.
The failed swordsman who pushed the button had his doubts but immediately felt tremendous power rising in his body. So he pushed the button many times.
However it was a cursed button. The moment it was pushed he was confined to the 100 million years prison of time. The first 100 years were devoted solely to training. After 1000 years he had forgotten why he swung his sword. He stopped thinking completely after 10000 years had passed. After 100 million years he became crippled and finally managed to return to the real world. At the same time losing all his memories from the past 100 million years the only thing that remained were his sword techniques. “I can become stronger just by pressing the button!” or so he thought and pushed the button many times after that. Foolishly trapping himself in that 100 million years of hell each time.
As he continued this loop he began to think “If I destroy this world will I get out of here?” A few billion years later he finally escaped from the loop.
